Each campaign / channel evaluated on incremental profit that it produces relative to its cost

ROI = \frac{\text{incremental profit due to advertising} - \text{cost of advertising}}{\text{cost of advertising}}

# Marketing Attribution Models 

**Marketing attribution** is the process for determining which marketing touchpoints led to a conversion

**Attribution models** are the rule, or set of rules, that determines how conversion credit is assigned to different marketing touchpoints

**Questions for review:**


* What are the touchpoints? 
* What is the attribution model?

class: font170
# The Business Problem 

**Seeking Answers to the following strategic questions**

* How can I attribute credit to multiple campaigns that contributed to generating a conversion?

The **attribution problem* assumes data on *individual* consumer journeys

Approaches to the solution:

* Rule Based Attribution 
* Data-driven Models

**Highlights:**

* Only 11% of surveyed marketers used advanced algorithmic attribution, while 35% favored rules-based attribution and 23% measured only first or last touch points.
* 33% of the surveyed marketers face challenges in: "Knowing how to leverage results to generate new insights and actions."

**Opportunity:** How to get strategic value out of attribution modelling tools!

# Last Touch Attribution

**Last touch** (**Last-click**): attribution looks backward from each conversion to find the *last ad* that the user saw (clicked) on prior to the conversion

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
url <- "figs/customer_journey.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```
.font70[
Source: [Attribution App (2022)](https://www.attributionapp.com/blog/what-is-multi-touch-attribution-how-do-i-choose-the-right-model/) 
]

<br/>
<br/>

**Remark**: Since consumers don't click on ads that much, attributed sales lower using last click.

---
class: font160
# Limitations of Last Touch

Mistakes when using last touch to estimate incremental sales:

1. **Other ads may have influenced customer & contributed to the sale**
  * Issue is well recognized
2. **All sales are treated as *incremental*** ... would  not have bought if did not see ads
  * Less well recognized
3. **Unfairly favours channels that tend to show ads towards the end of path to purchase**
  * Such as search, or ads served due to retargeting

---
class: font160
# When does Last Touch "work"?

Accurate measure of ad response when:

* All sales are **incremental**
  * $\rightarrow$ no sales would happen without the advertising
* **Effect of ads** on behaviour is **short-lived** and **ad exposures** are **spaced out** over time
  * No "assists" from other advertising channels

# First Touch Attribution

# Linear Attribution

**Linear Attribution**: attribution looks backward from each conversion to find the *each ad* that the user saw (clicked) on prior to the conversion assigning them equal weight

url <- "figs/customer_journey.png"

# Position Based Attribution 

**Position Based Attribution**: attribution looks backward from each conversion to find the *each ad* that the user saw (clicked) on prior to the conversion assigning higher weight to the *first* and *last*.

* Need to decide on *what* the higher weight is.
  * Commonly seen: 30% or 40% for both first and last

* aka U-Shaped Attribution

# Time Decay Attribution

**Time Decay**: attribution looks backward from each conversion to find the *each ad* that the user saw (clicked) on prior to the conversion assigning higher weight to more recent ads.

# Limitations of Rule Based Attribution

* Rule based solutions are **inflexible** and **unable to distinguish** between the true **low and high impact touch-points**
  *  Leads to an inaccurate division of credit.

* **Ignores** all customers that **don't convert**

* **Analyst / Manager decides the attribution**
  * Can pick something to show the results one needs

# Data-Driven Models

---
class: font160
# Data-Driven Attribution

**Key Difference:** dealing with mid-journey funnel in a non ad-hoc way

* .. and mid funnel parts of customer journeys matter ([Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/mid-funnel-marketing-brand-performance/))

Example Models:

1. Markov Attribution Models 
2. Shapley Value Attribution   

**Remark**: The methodologies are a little tough ...

* I'll give you a flavour of how they work
* ... and compare their performance using our example above

---
# Markov Attribution Models

**Markov attribution model**: a probabilistic model that represents buyer journeys as a graph, 
  * Graph's nodes are the touchpoints,
  * Graph's are observed transitions between those states

Simple Example: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
url <- "https://miro.medium.com/max/479/1*xGLzg4lqC1U9Gat2rYeaHQ.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)

# Markov Attribution Models

Key Notion: Measuring the **removal effect** 

* Simulate removing an advertising campaign from a graph ...
* ... Measure change in success rate (i.e. change in KPI)
* ... (the how to is beyond the scope of this class)

**Attribution value** of a given campaign is then:

$$
A = \text{Total Value of KPI} \times \frac{\text{Campaign Removal Effect}}{\text{Sum of All Removal Effects}}
$$

We'll skip the nitty gritty details - it gets computationally intensive

---
class: font160
# Shapley Value Attribution

**Shapley Value Attribution**: finds each ad campaigns **marginal contribution**, averaged over every sequence where the campaign could have been shown

* Different campaigns work *together* in cooperation to generate value (i.e. some KPI)
* Based on co-operative game theory (beyond the scope of this class...)

Key Idea: Measuring each campaigns **marginal contribution**

* Determined by what is gained or lost by removing them from a coalition of campaigns
* Order of ads doesn't matter (in the standard setup)

---

# Concluding Thoughts 

---
class: font160
# Summary

* Attribution Models assign conversion credits to marketing campaigns 

* Last Touch Attribution is one of the most common attribution models but has limitations

* Other ad-hoc models get around some of Last Touch's faults, but the allocation rules are somewhat arbitrary 

* Data driven methods improve on ad-hoc attribution by improving on how mid journey campaigns accrue credit 

* Shapley Value attribution uses marginal contributions to a coalition as a means to attribute KPIs to ads.

---
class: font160
# Remaining Issues

Outstanding issues in Marketing Attribution Models:

* **Cross-Device Journeys**
  - Example: search on computer *and* mobile

* **Cookie Destruction** 
  - Consumer deletion of history
  - Privacy regulations, GDPR, 'end of cookies'

* **Online / Offline Bridges** 
  - Exposure to offline campaigns (TV, newspapers) difficult to track at user level
